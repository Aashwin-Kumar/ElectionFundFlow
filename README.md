**Description:**
This dataset presents detailed information on electoral bond transactions facilitated by the State Bank of India (SBI). Electoral bonds are financial instruments that allow individuals and organizations to make anonymous donations to political parties in India. The dataset contains essential details such as the purchaser's name, the type of donor (business, individual, or trust), and other relevant information.

Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been performed on this dataset using Jupyter Notebook. Insights and patterns regarding electoral funding dynamics, donor characteristics, and transparency measures have been extracted to enhance the understanding of political financing in India.

**Columns:**
1. **Purchaser Name:** Name of the entity purchasing the electoral bonds.
2. **Denomination:** Name of the individual or organization making the donation.
3. **Type:** A new column added to segregate donors into two categories: "Individual" and "Firm" (representing businesses, companies, trusts, etc.).
4. **Date of Encashment:** The date when the electoral bonds were encashed.
5. **Name of the Political Party:** The political party receiving the donation.
6. **Denomination:** The face value or denomination of the electoral bonds.

**Usage:**
- Researchers, analysts, and policymakers can utilize this dataset to understand the patterns and trends in electoral funding in India.
- Investigative journalists can explore potential connections between political parties and donors.
- Data scientists and analysts can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify influential donors, and assess the impact of electoral bonds on political financing.

**Potential Analyses:**
1. Identify the most significant donors, both individual and firms, based on the amount of donation.
2. Analyze the distribution of donations across different types of donors (individuals vs. firms).
3. Investigate any patterns or correlations between donor types and political affiliations.
4. Explore geographical variations in electoral bond transactions.
5. Assess the effectiveness of electoral bonds in promoting transparency and accountability in political funding.

**Note:** The dataset has been enhanced by adding a new column "Type" to facilitate easier analysis and segmentation of donors into individual and firm categories.
